        To meet the current and future challenges, industry needs men of caliber. They however find that graduates churned out by Indian Universities and B-schools are no longer able to cope with the demands of present working environment. This paper traces the need for academe-industry partnership, how the two can work closely for mutual gains, and identify avenues for effective interfaces between them. Modes and mix of interfaces should be identified depending on the long term growth and development of both. Research should be done to develop a flexible Industry Partnership model for different academic set up.<br><br>
        
        
        
        <b>Introduction</b><br><br>
        Universities, colleges and other educational institutions being centers of higher education are established to assist in economic, social and cultural development of a country. They are required to enrich the students enhancing their employability, undertake research relevant to local needs, and make their knowledge and resources available to community through advice and consultancy services. They are accountable to society, to the students, to their employers, in short, to all the stakeholders of this education system. They must respond positively to the overall national education and development plans to impart quality education on a continual basis. Quality and excellence becomes essential for the teaching fraternity so as to produce men of quality and competence to match the needs and requirements of the employment seekers. Since the start of the economic reforms in India, the economy is on the rise. It is on the cusp of becoming one of the major economic powers. By 2050, our economy is expected be five times the size of Japan and our per capita income is expected to rise to 35 times its current level. Over the next two decades, India will not only the fastest growing of the world’s major economies but youngest in terms of median age of its work force. <br><br>
        
        Indian GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) stood at US $ 3.5 trillion in 2009 making it the fourth Largest economy. India’s service industry accounts for a robust 62.5% of the GDP with industrial sector contributing 20% to the GDP and agriculture sector contributing 17.5% to the GDP. India’s growth rate has clocked an average 7% since 1997 and this has been maintained even during times of global recession. India’s US $ 14 billion luxury goods market has attracted international brands such as Omega, Rolex, Tag Heuer, Cartier, Tommy Hilfiger, Gucci, Dolce and Gabbana. 80 million Indians have mobile phones and 2.5 million new customers sign up every month. The number of Indian air travelers is up 12.5% since 2003 and travel agents pitch European holidays to middle class families. The credit card industry is growing at 35% yearly. Automobile is another industry that has grown phenomenally in the last decade. <br><br>
        
        There is paradigm change in the demographics of India with a large youth population. The real challenge for young India is how to equip the youth to meet the emerging challenges channelised their energies and take the opportunities to the next level. It is here that the educational institutions can play the catalytic role of nurturing the students to meet the challenges of tomorrow.<br><br>
        
        Globalization and advancements in information and communication technology have opened up new vistas as well as challenges in Indian Education. National development in the emerging scenario requires improved and sophisticated skills which the individuals could get only through quality Education. To manage various industrial, businesses, commerce, technological and operational activities, skilled human competence in business enterprise is required.<br><br>
        
        “Structural adjustment” program in developing countries insisted upon by IMF and World Bank have led to fiscal restraints and emphasized the need for private investment and initiative in education sector. Accordingly, the Government of India has allowed almost unrestricted entry to the private sector. This has led to a proliferation of a large number of institutions in the profit driven private sector imparting education primarily in the field of commerce, management and information technology, hotel management, hospitality management, etc. These are the areas which promise jobs and higher earnings. Buyer today is willing to pay a premium for admission. Entry of private sector has thus made education a marketable commodity. <br><br>
        
        Academia- Industry Interface is an interactive and collaborative arrangement between academic institutions and business corporations for achievement of certain mutually inclusive goals and objectives. There is however a “disconnect” existing between the academic world and the industry. This has become more pronounced with the opening up of the economy with rapid changes in all sectors. There is no gainsaying the fact that there is an imperative need to bridge the widening gap between industry and academic circle to bring about synergy and congruence of goals between them. <br><br>
        
        Former Indian President, Dr. Abdul Kalam outlined the Mission of transforming India into a developed nation. This calls for concerted efforts in all spheres including education and industry. Is the academe geared to meet the vision of our Former President as also the emerging challenges due to globalization and liberalization? To catapult the Country as a developed nation by 2020, the Academe and the Industry can ill-afford to operate in separate domains, as hitherto, and would have to work in a collaborative manner.
